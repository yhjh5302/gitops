# Standalone

## When to use it

Use `standalone` when you want a single PostgreSQL instance with simple persistence and predictable operations.

Typical use cases:

- development and integration environments
- internal applications with a single writer and modest load
- production cases where restore-based recovery is acceptable

## What it delivers

- one PostgreSQL pod
- one persistent volume when persistence is enabled
- one client Service
- bootstrap of the app database and app user on first initialization, unless `initdb.runDefaultScript=false`
- optional custom init scripts
- optional `postgres_exporter`

## What it does not deliver

- automatic failover
- read scaling through replicas
- connection pooling
- backup orchestration

## Operational requirements

- a working storage class when persistence is enabled
- a secret management strategy for production passwords
- backup and restore procedures outside this chart

## Best practices

- use `auth.existingSecret` in production
- keep persistence enabled except for ephemeral test environments
- use resource requests and limits appropriate to your workload
- restrict `config.allowedClientCIDRs` and enable `networkPolicy.enabled=true` for production
- keep `serviceAccount.automountServiceAccountToken=false` unless a specific integration needs it
- monitor disk growth and autovacuum behavior early

## Example

```yaml
architecture: standalone

auth:
  existingSecret: postgresql-auth

standalone:
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    size: 20Gi
```
