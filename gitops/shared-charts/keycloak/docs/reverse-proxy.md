# Reverse Proxy and Hostname

## When to read this

Read this guide before exposing Keycloak through an ingress controller, API gateway, or reverse proxy.

## What this chart expects

- `mode: production`
- an explicit public hostname in `hostname.hostname`
- a reverse proxy or ingress in front of Keycloak
- the management interface kept internal on port `9000`

## Public and admin traffic

The chart supports two separate ingresses:

- `ingress.public` for user-facing traffic
- `ingress.admin` for the admin console and admin endpoints

This separation is useful when:

- the admin console must use a different `ingressClassName`
- the admin console should sit behind an internal load balancer
- the organization applies different WAF, IP allowlist, or authentication rules to admin traffic

Both ingresses still route only to the application service. They do not expose the management interface.

Gateway API can be used instead of Ingress when the cluster already provides Gateway API CRDs and a controller. The chart creates optional `HTTPRoute` resources and expects the platform to provide the referenced `Gateway`.

```yaml
gateway:
  public:
    enabled: true
    parentRefs:
      - name: public-gateway
        namespace: gateway-system
    hostnames:
      - sso.example.com
```

## Hostname model

Use these values together:

- `hostname.hostname`
- `hostname.admin`
- `proxy.headers`
- `http.relativePath`

Recommended production pattern:

```yaml
mode: production

hostname:
  hostname: https://sso.example.com
  admin: https://admin-sso.example.com

proxy:
  headers: xforwarded
  trustedAddresses: 10.0.0.0/8
```

Set `proxy.trustedAddresses` whenever the ingress or gateway source ranges are known. Keycloak ignores proxy headers from other addresses when this value is set.

`proxy.protocolEnabled=true` is available for platforms that use the HAProxy PROXY protocol. It cannot be combined with `proxy.headers`; set `proxy.headers: ""` when enabling PROXY protocol.

## Ingress guidance

Public ingress example:

```yaml
ingress:
  public:
    enabled: true
    ingressClassName: traefik
    annotations:
      cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt
    hosts:
      - host: sso.example.com
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
    tls:
      - hosts:
          - sso.example.com
        secretName: keycloak-tls
```

Admin ingress example:

```yaml
ingress:
  admin:
    enabled: true
    ingressClassName: internal-nginx
    annotations:
      cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-internal
    hosts:
      - host: admin-sso.example.com
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
    tls:
      - hosts:
          - admin-sso.example.com
        secretName: keycloak-admin-tls
```

## Sticky sessions

Sticky sessions are often useful for Keycloak, especially during login-heavy workloads and multi-step browser flows.

The chart does not force sticky-session annotations because the implementation depends on the ingress controller in front of Keycloak. Configure session affinity at the ingress or gateway layer used in the environment.

Examples:

- Traefik: cookie-based stickiness on the service or ingress route layer
- NGINX Ingress: cookie affinity annotations
- cloud load balancers or API gateways: platform-specific persistence settings

Treat sticky sessions as a reverse-proxy responsibility, not as an application-service toggle.

## Relative path

If Keycloak must live below a path prefix, configure `http.relativePath` and align the ingress path with it.

Example:

```yaml
http:
  relativePath: /auth

ingress:
  public:
    hosts:
      - host: sso.example.com
        paths:
          - path: /auth
            pathType: Prefix
```

Do not change the relative path in production without validating discovery documents, redirect URIs, and upstream clients.

## Rollout checklist

- verify public hostname resolves to the intended ingress
- verify admin hostname resolves only through the intended admin exposure path
- verify TLS certificates are mounted and valid at both hostnames
- verify login, logout, and admin console flows after rollout
- verify readiness and liveness endpoints through the management service, not through ingress
